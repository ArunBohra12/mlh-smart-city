# mlh-smart-city

## üí° Inspiration

I was going back to my home, when I saw a huge banner stating that my city would become a **SMART CITY** and just beneath it was a huge mountain of garbage becz there were no garbage bins, quite an Irony.

So when I though of what will make my city smart, then ther came a lot of factors like good infrastructure, education, transport, healthcare. But the most impoertant 2 factors are the **GOVERNMENT** and the **GENERAL PUBLIC**. So though of building an idea which could connect citizens directly to the govt and help becoming a smart city faster.

## üíª What it does

- Through XXX, citizens or general public can directly raise their issues to the government or authorities in power in their area.
- People can raise **ISSUES** and give a detailed description of the issue like an image for proof, description, address.
- Helpers would look into these issues and see if they are valid or not. If valid, they would **APPROVE** the issue
- Who are **Helpers** --> Socially Active people doing good work for society or government officials
- Once an issue is approved, the local government can start working on that issue and they would have to give regular updates on the issue
- Once worked on, helpers may close the issue and an issue can only be closed only when there are updates on the Issue.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Figma
- Postman

## Best use of MongoDB Atlas

We have used MongoDb Atlas for storing our data, these are some of the features that we have used :-

1. Mongoose Model :- We havde created schemas for User, Helpers, Issues and Notifications.

2. Using Pre Hooks :- Used pre hooks in Schemas to populate data while fetching and modifying data before storing in DB.

3. Mongodb operators :- User operators like Push and Pull to update arrays in Database

## Most creative use of Github

We collaborated and shared our code through a githib repo nad used these features :-

1. Regular and small commits
2. Raised Issues - Issues were raised for the bugs of enhancements that were found in the project throughout the hackathon
3. Detailed Decumentation

## üß† Challenges we ran into

1. integration of api
2. designing and prototyping in figma

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

1) Since none of us have any prior major experience with designing in Figma, we overcame and built a prototype in 36 hours
2) Made navbar with framer motion
3) Completed and made fully functional prototype of project with api's .

## üìñ What we learned

1. Working in group
2. Learnt and used framer motion ,styled components and pop-up modal
3. Learnt how to connect backend and frontend

## üöÄ What's next for

1.  Adding comment in single issues page.
